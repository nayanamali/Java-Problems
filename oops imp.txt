//child class access all properties ( Variables and methos) of parent class  as well as it's own properties(Variables and Methods)
//Most Imp feacture of inheritance is Data reusability


//Inheritance : Inheritance is used to establish relationship between two or more class where one class is a child child and other is parent class
 //give example : Animal


//polymorphism can be achieved through method

//when we use same method for performing multiple task within same class it know as method overloading( polymorphism).


//Polymorphism means many form of same anmethods 


//using same method of parent class into child class known as method overriding.


//Encapsulation: It provide protection to data members and method of class ( It cannot be access directly)

//Encapsulation can be achieved through access modifier


//it uses public getters and setters to acesss private data members

//Showing important feacture and hiding unnessary details from user known as Abstraction.

//Abstraction can be achived through Abstract class and Interface      (ex: in bank it shows only important withdrow functionality but hides code behind it)

//Interface is used to achieve abstraction in terms of 100%

//Abstract class can used to achieve abstraction in 0-100%
